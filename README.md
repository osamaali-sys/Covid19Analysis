Trying to recreate a project performed by the highly skilled @terenceshin from back in April 2020 which can be found below

### Tools

Jupyter Notebook, python, pandas, plotly and its libraries

csv_file = "dataset/covid_19_data.csv"

### Objective

Get a visual analysis of covid 19 using the updated data on a USA map.

We will be using the choropleth method for our visualization.

Our next step is to create a timeframe of the spread.

This step required adding an actionpane to the figure and setting Data as a variable. Gif could not be inserted to github readme but these are the images from the animated choropleth at work. Images are 2 months apart from another.
